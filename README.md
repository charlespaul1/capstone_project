# capstone_project Little Lemon Restaurant
This is my capstone project for my frontend developer course at cousera, where i was tasked to include a booking feature to the Little Restaurant website.

The website is built using HTML, React, JavaScript, CSS, and utilizes various tools and libraries such as Figma for design, Chakra UI for styling, Formik for form management, and Yup for form validation

## Problem statement

The Little Lemon Restaurant faced a challenge where their website did not have a reservation feature. This meant that customers had to call or visit the restaurant in person to make a reservation which was sometimes very difficult, leading to inconvenience and potential missed opportunities. To address this issue, the team decided to implement a reservation feature directly on the website, allowing customers to book a table hassle-free.

## Pages
The Little Lemon Restaurant website consists of the following pages:

`1. ` **Home Page**: The landing page of the website that provides an introduction to the restaurant, highlights its unique features, and encourages visitors to explore the menu and make reservations.

`2. ` **Menu Page**: This page showcases the restaurant's menu, including various dishes, beverages, and special offers. Customers can browse through the available options and make their selections.
 
`3. ` **Booking Page**: The reservation feature is implemented on this page. Customers can fill out a form to book a table by specifying their preferred date, time, number of guests, the occasion and personal details. The form is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, providing a smooth booking experience.

## Design
The design of the Little Lemon Restaurant website was created using Figma. Figma enabled me to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience. The design elements include color schemes, typography, layout, and interactive components.

## Technologies and Libraries used
- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure and layout of the website pages
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
